# Elementary Audio Offline Rendering Examples

audio files. Each subdirectory contains a self-contained script to execute and a README
explaining what the process does and how to use it from your command line.

**Note**: Offline rendering is only available in the `@elemaudio/offline-renderer` package hosted in
the Elementary private npm registry. This feature is available only to paid license holders.
